Inode blocks and Data blocks.

================

given FS image size, create 8 cylinder groups, each initially a clone of the
other, aside from group number.  each cylinder group should have 2*block_size
bytes per inode.  Based on this, determine the number of data blocks.

total size = 1600 blocks
1600/8 = 200 blocks per group
block size = 512
bytes per inode = 512 * 2 = 1024 bytes
bytes per group = 200 * 512 = 102400 bytes
inodes per group = 102400/1024 = 100
inodes per block = 512 / 64 = 8
inode blocks per group = 100 / 8 = 12.5 -> 13
for 200 blocks, need one superblock
need 200 / 512 + 1 = 1 blocks for bitmaps
200 - 13 - 1 - 1 = 186 data blocks per group
